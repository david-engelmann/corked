# stickler

Stickler is a command line tool that reviews code against named rules. It checks a diff with a built in checker, and it prints readings over verdicts that decision model routes recorded while judging a change set against those rules.

## What this is

Stickler takes one file per command and prints one rendering. Every command runs offline, and no command calls a model. The recorded verdicts the readings run over were produced in earlier rounds by the routes they name and stand committed under examples as fixtures.

The check command reads a unified diff and builds a review with the built in checker. The checker holds a fixed set of rules over the shapes of code a diff can carry, and each objection it raises names the rule the code breaks and the change that would clear the objection. The render command reads a review recorded as JSON and prints the review rendering from the record.

The review command reads a change set. A change set lists flags, and each flag names a file, a line, and a pattern. The change set also carries the verdicts on its flags, recorded by decision model routes through the verdict seat. The set review prints the judgement of each flag, the lines where the routes that judged one flag disagree as the contested lines, and a summary tally of the verdicts.

The census command reads a census file that names a collection of recorded review inputs and prints the judging census. The census gives a tally of the judgements for each set in the collection and a total tally over the whole collection, counting files, judgements, and verdicts.

The rejudged command reads a file that names two recorded sets of verdicts over the same flags and prints the rejudged ledger. The ledger states the judgement of each flag in the first set and in the second set, and whether that judgement held or changed between the two sets.

The split command reads a file that names one recorded set and two routes and prints the split reading. The split reading states the judgement of each flag under the first route alone, under the second route alone, and under both routes jointly, and it closes with counts of the flags read, the flags where the routes agree, the flags where they differ, and the flags where the joint judgement differs from a route.

## Status

Seeded in October 2026. Setup has landed, and Rounds 1 to 9 have closed, with all slices merged on main. Part of the Spectacle line in the 39 repo storefront perfection programme.

## Programme status

- Closed perfection rounds, 9 of 100. A round counts only when a full cycle of work, audit, review, red team, and approval has closed. Seeding and setup are not rounds.
- Contract, SETUP-1 to SETUP-4 and CK-1 to CK-6 met. CK-1 to CK-4 stand in full form in CONTRACT.md with the Round 1 repair amendments, and Round 1 closed on the merged slice 2 after three reviews, a repair pass, and an approving re-review.
- Contract, CK-5 and CK-6 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md with the Round 2 repair amendments, and Round 2 closed on the merged slice 3 after three reviews, a repair pass, and an approving re-review.
- Slice 2 has landed. It carries the review core, the built in checker with its four named shapes, the shared rendering, and the check and render commands, all running offline on recorded or local input. The first slice is a strict review of one diff against named standards, objections named with the rewrite each one would accept.
- Slice 3 has landed. It carries the two remaining definition time shapes, the call default and the class attribute with its class context read from the diff itself, and the set level review with the review command, over one synthetic change set under examples.
- Contract, CK-7 and CK-8 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md with the Round 3 repair amendments, and Round 3 closed on the merged slice 4 after three reviews, a repair pass, and an approving re-review.
- Slice 4 has landed. It carries the borderline flagging with its three patterns, the verdict seat reading both decision model routes, the recorded verdict path through the set review, and the recorded borderline pilot under examples, with the suite running offline on the recorded envelopes.
- Contract, CK-9 and CK-10 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md with the Round 4 repair amendments, and Round 4 closed on the merged slice 5 after three reviews, a repair pass, and an approving re-review.
- Slice 5 has landed. It carries the contested line reading of the set review, with the contested section before the summary and the contested count in the summary, and the constructed contested example under examples, with the suite running offline on the recorded pilot and the constructed example.
- Contract, CK-11 and CK-12 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md, and Round 5 closed on the merged slice 6 after three reviews, a repair pass, and an approving owner gate.
- Slice 6 has landed. It carries the judging census over a stated collection of recorded review inputs, with the census command beside check, render, and review, and the census example under examples standing over the Round 2 set, the pilot set, and the constructed Round 4 example named as constructed, with the suite running offline on the recorded and constructed sets.
- Contract, CK-13 and CK-14 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md with the Round 6 repair amendment, and Round 6 closed on the merged slice 7 after three reviews, a repair pass, and an approving re-review.
- Slice 7 has landed. It carries the rejudging run over the pilot flags through the verdict seat's Jev route, recorded as the rejudged set under examples, and the rejudged ledger reading over a stated pair of recorded sets, with the rejudged command beside check, render, review, and census, with the suite running offline on the recorded envelopes and sets.
- Contract, CK-15 and CK-16 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md, and Round 7 closed on the merged slice 8 after three reviews, a repair pass, and an approving re-review.
- Slice 8 has landed. It carries the split reading over one recorded set, stating the judgement of each of its flags under the first named route alone, under the second named route alone, and under both routes jointly, with the split example over the pilot set under examples, and the split command beside check, render, review, census, and rejudged, with the suite running offline on the recorded verdicts.
- Contract, CK-17 and CK-18 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md with the Round 8 repair amendments, and Round 8 closed on the merged slice 9 after three reviews, a repair pass, and an approving re-review.
- Slice 9 has landed. It carries the contested reading over a recorded collection of change sets, one section per set in collection order, naming each set's contested flags with file, line, and pattern, or the no contest line where a set holds none, with per set flags read and contested counts and closing counts over the whole collection, with the contested example under examples standing over the same collection as the census example, and the contested command beside check, render, review, census, rejudged, and split, with the suite running offline on the recorded verdicts.
- Contract, CK-19 and CK-20 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md with the FIX-CK-21 fencing closure, and Round 9 closed on the merged slice 10 after three reviews approving with no findings, with the red team's one observation on the single review rendering carried to Round 10 as a fencing component.
- Slice 10 has landed. It carries the pattern reading over a recorded collection of change sets, one section per borderline pattern in the order the contract states them, naming each flag of the collection standing under that pattern with file, line, and the set it stands in, with per section flags read and contested counts and closing counts over the whole collection, with the pattern example under examples standing over the same collection as the census example, and the pattern command beside check, render, review, census, rejudged, split, and contested, and the library fencing closure over the census, rejudged, split, and set review renderings, with the suite running offline on the recorded verdicts.
- The Rust port has landed. It carries the behavior the Python package carried, checked against the same goldens, and the Python tree stands removed under PORT-9.
- Local gate, cargo test, cargo fmt --check, and cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings. CI runs the same commands.
